    "text": "1.1 Summary\nThis week I built a basic understanding of remote sensing and Earth observation, and I used Sentinel-2 imagery to make simple visual outputs for West London. Remote sensing works by measuring electromagnetic radiation across different wavelengths and linking those signals to surface features and processes. Passive sensors mainly record reflected solar energy, while active sensors transmit energy and measure the return signal. Whether a dataset fits an urban question depends on trade-offs between spatial, temporal, spectral, and radiometric resolution, and also on practical limits such as cloud cover and atmospheric effects.\nI focused on visual interpretation in SNAP using two Sentinel-2 composites. The true colour image provides a familiar view of the urban landscape and supports quick identification of built-up areas, water, and major green spaces. The false colour composite maps near-infrared information into a visible channel, so vegetation becomes visually distinct and appears red or brighter. This helped me separate green space patterns from buildings and roads and connect the appearance of land cover to spectral behaviour. (Kerle, Janssen, and Bakker 2004a; Butcher 2016)\nA key learning point is the difference between display and data. In SNAP, the histogram and contrast stretching tools change how the image looks on screen by redistributing brightness and contrast, but they do not change the underlying pixel values. This matters because visual outputs are useful for exploration and communication, while analysis must rely on the original values and a transparent processing workflow. (Jensen 2016a)",

Studies using Sentinel-2 at 10 m calculate NDVI from the red band and the near infrared band to map urban greenness and compare it with deprivation and access to parks (Robinson et al. 2022). This works because vegetation has a strong response in near infrared, so the index separates trees and grass from roofs and roads (Jensen 2016b). For my study area I can summarise seasonal NDVI for each neighbourhood and highlight places with low greenness near busy roads. I can then connect these spatial patterns to London policy goals on green infrastructure and access to green space (“London Environment Strategy | London City Hall,” n.d.).\nHeat risk is a second application where sensor trade offs matter. The Greater London Authority has released a map of summer heat hotspots derived from Landsat thermal land surface temperature, built from several summers of images (“Major Summer Heat Spots Using Landsat-8 Thermal Satellite Data - London Datastore,” n.d.). Landsat has a long archive and consistent pixels, so it is useful for comparing heat patterns across years, but cloud and revisit limits mean I should use multi date composites and focus on clear scenes . In West London I can overlay Landsat heat hotspots with Sentinel-2 greenness to find streets where low vegetation aligns with high surface temperature. This can support targeted cooling actions such as tree planting, shade design, and monitoring progress over time.\n\n\n\nWork flow",

    "text": "1.3 Reflection\nThis week changed how I think about remote sensing. I used to see satellite images as pictures, but now I see them as measurements of energy and materials. In West London, the first real challenge is not choosing an index, but choosing data that fits the scale of the question. Small parks and street trees push me toward higher spatial resolution, while the need to separate vegetation from built surfaces depends on spectral behaviour in the red and near infrared (Kerle, Janssen, and Bakker 2004b). At the same time, London cloud makes many optical scenes unusable, so a realistic workflow needs cloud filtering and multi date composites, not a single perfect image. This also matters for policy use. A map that looks clean can still hide uncertainty from seasonality, mixed pixels, and missing observations. My main lesson is that the four resolutions are not theory, they are constraints that shape what is possible and what is fair to claim (Jensen 2016c). Next week I want to keep my work reproducible by recording every choice I make, including area of interest, dates, and quality filters, so that my results can be checked and updated.\n\n\n\n\nButcher, Ginger. 2016.
