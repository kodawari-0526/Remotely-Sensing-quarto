    "text": "4.1 Summary\nThis week focused on image corrections and image enhancement for remote sensing analysis. The lecture explained why raw pixel values are not stable across space and time. Geometric correction aligns an image to the ground so that each pixel is in the right place. This can involve ground control points, a transformation model, and resampling to a common grid.(Jensen 2016a) Atmospheric correction reduces scattering and absorption so values are closer to surface reflectance.(“Radiative Transfer and Atmospheric Correction” 2013)This supports fair comparison across dates and sensors and helps change analysis. The lecture also introduced analysis ready data, where key corrections are already applied, but the user still needs to understand what the product includes and what limits remain.(“CEOS Analysis Ready Data,” n.d.)\nIn the practical I used Landsat Collection 2 Level 2 surface reflectance for Cape Town.(“Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 Science Products | U.S. Geological Survey” 2022) I loaded only the surface reflectance bands and clipped them to my study area polygon. My shapefile had a missing coordinate system, so I assigned WGS84 and then transformed it to the Landsat projection before crop and mask. After clipping I created several enhancement layers. I calculated NDVI from the red and near infrared bands to describe vegetation activity.(Jensen 2016b) The NDVI map shows higher values in the mountain and green areas and lower values over water and dense built surfaces.\nI then applied a vegetation mask using an NDVI threshold of 0.2 to separate likely vegetation from other land covers. This mask is simple and fast, but it can include false positives where soil is bright or where shadows change the index.(Jensen 2016c)\nNext I tested spatial filtering on the red band. A low pass 3 by 3 mean filter reduced local noise and made broad patterns clearer. A high pass Laplacian filter highlighted edges, which made coastlines and sharp land cover boundaries more visible.\nI also computed a texture proxy using a 7 by 7 local standard deviation. This layer emphasised heterogeneous urban fabric and mixed surfaces. Finally I fused the surface reflectance bands with the texture layer and ran PCA. The PCA composite increased contrast between major surface types and showed that combining spectral and spatial features can reveal structure that is not clear in one band.",

    "text": "2.1 Summary\nThis week I built a basic understanding of remote sensing and Earth observation, and I used Sentinel-2 imagery to make simple visual outputs for West London. Remote sensing works by measuring electromagnetic radiation across different wavelengths and linking those signals to surface features and processes. Passive sensors mainly record reflected solar energy, while active sensors transmit energy and measure the return signal. Whether a dataset fits an urban question depends on trade-offs between spatial, temporal, spectral, and radiometric resolution, and also on practical limits such as cloud cover and atmospheric effects.\nI focused on visual interpretation in SNAP using two Sentinel-2 composites. The true colour image provides a familiar view of the urban landscape and supports quick identification of built-up areas, water, and major green spaces. The false colour composite maps near-infrared information into a visible channel, so vegetation becomes visually distinct and appears red or brighter. This helped me separate green space patterns from buildings and roads and connect the appearance of land cover to spectral behaviour. (Kerle, Janssen, and Bakker 2004a; Butcher 2016)\nA key learning point is the difference between display and data. In SNAP, the histogram and contrast stretching tools change how the image looks on screen by redistributing brightness and contrast, but they do not change the underlying pixel values. This matters because visual outputs are useful for exploration and communication, while analysis must rely on the original values and a transparent processing workflow. (Jensen 2016a)",

Studies using Sentinel-2 at 10 m calculate NDVI from the red band and the near infrared band to map urban greenness and compare it with deprivation and access to parks (Robinson et al. 2022). This works because vegetation has a strong response in near infrared, so the index separates trees and grass from roofs and roads (Jensen 2016b). For my study area I can summarise seasonal NDVI for each neighbourhood and highlight places with low greenness near busy roads. I can then connect these spatial patterns to London policy goals on green infrastructure and access to green space (“London Environment Strategy | London City Hall,” n.d.).\nHeat risk is a second application where sensor trade offs matter. The Greater London Authority has released a map of summer heat hotspots derived from Landsat thermal land surface temperature, built from several summers of images (“Major Summer Heat Spots Using Landsat-8 Thermal Satellite Data - London Datastore,” n.d.). Landsat has a long archive and consistent pixels, so it is useful for comparing heat patterns across years, but cloud and revisit limits mean I should use multi date composites and focus on clear scenes . In West London I can overlay Landsat heat hotspots with Sentinel-2 greenness to find streets where low vegetation aligns with high surface temperature. This can support targeted cooling actions such as tree planting, shade design, and monitoring progress over time.\n\n\n\nWork flow",

    "text": "2.3 Reflection\nThis week changed how I think about remote sensing. I used to see satellite images as pictures, but now I see them as measurements of energy and materials. In West London, the first real challenge is not choosing an index, but choosing data that fits the scale of the question. Small parks and street trees push me toward higher spatial resolution, while the need to separate vegetation from built surfaces depends on spectral behaviour in the red and near infrared (Kerle, Janssen, and Bakker 2004b). At the same time, London cloud makes many optical scenes unusable, so a realistic workflow needs cloud filtering and multi date composites, not a single perfect image. This also matters for policy use. A map that looks clean can still hide uncertainty from seasonality, mixed pixels, and missing observations. My main lesson is that the four resolutions are not theory, they are constraints that shape what is possible and what is fair to claim (Jensen 2016c). Next week I want to keep my work reproducible by recording every choice I make, including area of interest, dates, and quality filters, so that my results can be checked and updated.\n\n\n\n\nButcher, Ginger. 2016.

    "text": "4.2 Applications\nCorrections matter when a study compares images across time or across sensors. Atmospheric effects can shift reflectance values even if the surface is unchanged, so surface reflectance products are often preferred for monitoring vegetation, drought, or urban change.(Jensen 2016c; “Landsat 8-9 Collection 2 Level 2 Science Product Guide | U.S. Geological Survey” 2024a) A Cape Town drought study used Landsat data with vegetation indices to map drought severity and its spatial pattern, which shows how corrected reflectance supports environmental analysis at city scale.(Orimoloye et al. 2019) In practice, using an analysis ready product reduces processing time, but it does not remove the need for quality checks. Cloud, haze, and shadow still affect pixels, and each product has its own algorithm and quality masks.For mosaics or multi scene analysis, consistent correction also helps to reduce seams and brightness jumps before compositing or further modelling\nEnhancement methods then turn corrected bands into features that match a research question. NDVI is a simple ratio that isolates vegetation signal and reduces some illumination effects, so it is widely used for mapping urban greenness and tracking stress. In my outputs, the NDVI and the vegetation mask provide a fast first separation between vegetated and non vegetated surfaces, which could support later classification or sampling design. Spatial filters and texture measures add information about local structure. Edge filters can highlight roads, coastlines, and block boundaries, while local variability can separate smooth water from complex built surfaces. Urban land cover studies often combine spectral indices with extra features and tuned thresholds because cities mix materials within one pixel and create strong shadow effects.(Faridatul and Wu 2018) Data fusion extends this idea by combining sensors with different strengths. A review on multispectral and radar fusion shows that combining datasets can improve monitoring when optical data are limited by clouds and when structure information is needed.(Schulte To Bühne and Pettorelli 2018) My fused PCA step followed the same logic at a smaller scale by combining reflectance with a texture layer, then using PCA to compress the information into a few components that are easier to visualise and can be used as inputs for models.(Jensen 2016d)",

    "text": "4.3 Reflection\nThis week helped me link theory about corrections with practical feature building. I now see surface reflectance as a foundation for most comparisons, but I also see the risk of treating it as a black box. For my Cape Town workflow, the first challenge was not an algorithm but metadata, because my study area file had no coordinate system. Fixing the coordinate system and matching projections was essential before any analysis. This reminds me that good results depend on simple checks such as coordinate reference systems, band names, and missing data.\nThe enhancement steps were fast to run, but they involve choices that affect meaning. An NDVI threshold of 0.2 is easy to explain, yet it is not universal and it can confuse sparse vegetation, bright soil, and shadow. Texture and filtering depend on window size. A 7 by 7 window shows broad heterogeneity but can miss small features, and larger windows increase computation. The high pass filter made boundaries clearer, but it also amplified noise, so it needs careful display scaling and may not be stable for quantitative use without normalisation.\nNext I want to improve this workflow by using the Landsat quality masks to remove clouds and by testing how sensitive results are to threshold and window size.(“Landsat 8-9 Collection 2 Level 2 Science Product Guide | U.S. Geological Survey” 2024b) I also want to connect these features to an outcome, such as a supervised land cover map or a change map, so that I can evaluate whether added features truly improve performance rather than just looking visually better.\n\n\n\n\n“CEOS Analysis Ready Data.” n.d. https://ceos.org/ard/.\n\n\nFaridatul, Mst Ilme, and Bo Wu. 2018. “Automatic Classification of Major Urban Land Covers Based on Novel Spectral Indices.” ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information 7 (12): 453. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi7120453.\n\n\nJensen, John R. 2016a.

Now I am a student at UCL in the MSc Urban Spatial Science programme.\nMy study direction is related to digital twins and data-driven methods for urban problems. In my undergraduate study, I learned basic urban and transport design. I also used Python for programming and machine learning. However, GIS, remote sensing, R, statistics, and urban policy research are new to me.\nI am interested in connecting remote sensing or sensor data with computer vision (CV) and large language models (LLMs). I want to use these methods to solve urban problems. I care more about climate and resilient cities. This topic is important to me because I enjoy digital twins and I have internship experience in this area. I also want to develop this into my dissertation topic. I think CV and LLMs have strong potential in urban spatial science, and there are still many research gaps.\nIn this module, I want to build a solid foundation in remote sensing. I want to understand and compare different sensors and datasets, for example how different spatial resolutions affect results. In the future, I hope to use strong remote sensing knowledge to support interdisciplinary research and publish academic papers.\nI will use this learning diary to read more related papers and build my own literature library. I will also record my practical work, outputs, and questions each week. By the end of the term, I hope to have a useful literature collection that can support my future research, including possible PhD study.",

    "text": "5.1 Summary\nThis week focused on turning a city policy challenge into a measurable monitoring plan using Earth Observation. I selected London and the challenge of extreme heat risk that is uneven across neighbourhoods. Heat is not only a climate issue. It is also a public health and environmental justice issue because exposure and vulnerability can cluster in the same places. A practical policy response needs clear targets, clear responsibilities, and a way to measure change over time. In London, greening policy already exists through the London Plan and the Urban Greening Factor guidance, which asks major developments to treat greening as a core design element and to report a greening score. This creates a strong entry point for EO evidence because EO can measure where heat and greenness are high or low, and whether patterns shift after investment and planning decisions.\nI propose a simple EO indicator set that can support both targeting and accountability. First, Land Surface Temperature from Landsat Collection 2 Level 2 can provide a consistent time series to map hot surfaces and to track change after interventions such as new tree cover, green roofs, and shade. The product is designed as a surface temperature science product with quality layers and consistent processing, which supports repeatable analysis across seasons and years. Second, greenness from Sentinel 2 Level 2A surface reflectance can be used to calculate NDVI as a transparent indicator of vegetation signal at high spatial detail. These two indicators allow a policy narrative that is easy to explain. Where surfaces are hottest and greenness is lowest, London can prioritise greening actions and cooling design, then monitor whether the gap closes over time.\nThis approach aligns with global agendas. SDG 11 calls for inclusive and resilient cities, SDG 13 focuses on climate action, SDG 3 links to health, and SDG 10 links to reducing inequality. EO is valuable here because it can provide comparable evidence for progress and for fairness, not only for average city outcomes but also for the distribution of benefits.",

    "text": "5.2 Applications\nEarth observation can support routine policy tasks such as monitoring, targeting, and evaluation. Gerasopoulos et al. describe EO as a practical input to urban governance when data are timely, accessible, and connected to decision needs . My workflow follows this logic by choosing open satellite products and by defining clear outputs that match a policy question, where to act first for urban cooling and greening. Wellmann et al. also show that remote sensing can contribute to planning, but only when results are translated into planning language and linked to the policy cycle . This is why I frame outputs as priority zones and measurable indicators, not only as scientific maps. Kadhim et al. review urban sustainability applications and highlight the need to connect methods to real policy use .\nLi et al. connect historical inequality, urban heat, and health outcomes with spatial models across multiple cities . It provides evidence that heat exposure reflects structural injustice, which supports an equity based policy framing. Yet studies like this can stop before the last step, the design of an implementable planning rule or investment plan. I use it as a warning that correlation is not enough for policy. Martinez and Labib add another warning. They show that NDVI is often treated as a direct measure of green exposure, but it can hide differences between trees, grass, and season . For policy, this means NDVI should be used with care, and ideally combined with tree canopy or land cover when the policy aim is shade and cooling.\nTo move from evidence to action, I align the workflow with a simple governance pathway. First, use heat hotspot and greenness deficit maps to select candidate priority areas. Second, connect these zones to specific instruments, minimum greening requirements for new development and targeted canopy programs for existing neighbourhoods . Third, monitor change each year with the same EO indicators, and report progress against SDG 11 targets and London Plan objectives. This creates a repeatable loop that supports transparency and learning, while keeping uncertainty explicit.",

    "text": "5.3 Reflection\nThis week helped me see the difference between a technical map and a policy tool. A policy tool needs a clear user, a clear decision point, and a clear statement of uncertainty . The biggest barrier is often not data access. It is skills, time, and coordination across teams. Planning teams, public health teams, and climate teams may use different standards and different timelines. EO products can also be challenged by cloud cover, mixed pixels, and the gap between land surface temperature and lived heat stress (Jensen2015?). These issues can reduce trust if they are not communicated simply.\nFairness is not automatic in data driven policy. If the city targets only the hottest places, it may miss communities with high vulnerability but moderate heat. If it targets only the most deprived places, it may overlook extreme hotspots that create acute health risk. An equity approach should combine exposure and vulnerability, and it should be checked with local knowledge . This is where community engagement and local sensor data can improve the EO screening maps. It also links to the idea that city level strategies often fail at the local scale, unless they are tied to implementable rules and budgets .\nFor my own practice, I learned to design EO analysis around a policy workflow, not around a dataset. I will carry this into later work by defining indicators first, then choosing data that can be updated and explained. I also want to extend beyond NDVI by adding tree canopy and impervious surface, so the policy message is closer to shade, cooling, and access to green public space.",
