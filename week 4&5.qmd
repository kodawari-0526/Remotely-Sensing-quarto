## Summary

This week focused on turning a city policy challenge into a measurable monitoring plan using Earth Observation. I selected London and the challenge of extreme heat risk that is uneven across neighbourhoods. Heat is not only a climate issue. It is also a public health and environmental justice issue because exposure and vulnerability can cluster in the same places. A practical policy response needs clear targets, clear responsibilities, and a way to measure change over time. In London, greening policy already exists through the London Plan and the Urban Greening Factor guidance, which asks major developments to treat greening as a core design element and to report a greening score. This creates a strong entry point for EO evidence because EO can measure where heat and greenness are high or low, and whether patterns shift after investment and planning decisions.

I propose a simple EO indicator set that can support both targeting and accountability. First, Land Surface Temperature from Landsat Collection 2 Level 2 can provide a consistent time series to map hot surfaces and to track change after interventions such as new tree cover, green roofs, and shade. The product is designed as a surface temperature science product with quality layers and consistent processing, which supports repeatable analysis across seasons and years. Second, greenness from Sentinel 2 Level 2A surface reflectance can be used to calculate NDVI as a transparent indicator of vegetation signal at high spatial detail. These two indicators allow a policy narrative that is easy to explain. Where surfaces are hottest and greenness is lowest, London can prioritise greening actions and cooling design, then monitor whether the gap closes over time.

This approach aligns with global agendas. SDG 11 calls for inclusive and resilient cities, SDG 13 focuses on climate action, SDG 3 links to health, and SDG 10 links to reducing inequality. EO is valuable here because it can provide comparable evidence for progress and for fairness, not only for average city outcomes but also for the distribution of benefits. 


## Applications

Earth observation can support routine policy tasks such as monitoring, targeting, and evaluation. Gerasopoulos et al. describe EO as a practical input to urban governance when data are timely, accessible, and connected to decision needs . My workflow follows this logic by choosing open satellite products and by defining clear outputs that match a policy question, where to act first for urban cooling and greening. Wellmann et al. also show that remote sensing can contribute to planning, but only when results are translated into planning language and linked to the policy cycle . This is why I frame outputs as priority zones and measurable indicators, not only as scientific maps. Kadhim et al. review urban sustainability applications and highlight the need to connect methods to real policy use .

Li et al. connect historical inequality, urban heat, and health outcomes with spatial models across multiple cities . It provides evidence that heat exposure reflects structural injustice, which supports an equity based policy framing. Yet studies like this can stop before the last step, the design of an implementable planning rule or investment plan. I use it as a warning that correlation is not enough for policy. Martinez and Labib add another warning. They show that NDVI is often treated as a direct measure of green exposure, but it can hide differences between trees, grass, and season . For policy, this means NDVI should be used with care, and ideally combined with tree canopy or land cover when the policy aim is shade and cooling.

To move from evidence to action, I align the workflow with a simple governance pathway. First, use heat hotspot and greenness deficit maps to select candidate priority areas. Second, connect these zones to specific instruments, minimum greening requirements for new development and targeted canopy programs for existing neighbourhoods . Third, monitor change each year with the same EO indicators, and report progress against SDG 11 targets and London Plan objectives. This creates a repeatable loop that supports transparency and learning, while keeping uncertainty explicit.



## Reflection

This week helped me see the difference between a technical map and a policy tool. A policy tool needs a clear user, a clear decision point, and a clear statement of uncertainty . The biggest barrier is often not data access. It is skills, time, and coordination across teams. Planning teams, public health teams, and climate teams may use different standards and different timelines. EO products can also be challenged by cloud cover, mixed pixels, and the gap between land surface temperature and lived heat stress [@Jensen2015]. These issues can reduce trust if they are not communicated simply.

Fairness is not automatic in data driven policy. If the city targets only the hottest places, it may miss communities with high vulnerability but moderate heat. If it targets only the most deprived places, it may overlook extreme hotspots that create acute health risk. An equity approach should combine exposure and vulnerability, and it should be checked with local knowledge . This is where community engagement and local sensor data can improve the EO screening maps. It also links to the idea that city level strategies often fail at the local scale, unless they are tied to implementable rules and budgets .

For my own practice, I learned to design EO analysis around a policy workflow, not around a dataset. I will carry this into later work by defining indicators first, then choosing data that can be updated and explained. I also want to extend beyond NDVI by adding tree canopy and impervious surface, so the policy message is closer to shade, cooling, and access to green public space.
